# sky130_rtl_design_synthesis

Part1
Design: - Behavioral representation of specification written in HDL language like vhdl, Verilog or system Verilog.
Testbench: - Component use to generate set of inputs for design and compare the output results with the specification. 
Simulator: - tool use to check the design meets the defined requirements when some sets of inputs are applied through testbench. It takes design, testbench files and generate vcd file i.e value change dump file.
Synthesizer: - Checks the design and translate the RTL design into the netlist. Netlist is the representation of design in the from of standard cells like gates, flops and muxes.
